                        The Little Red Book features quotations from Mao's writings. It is small and bound in a red plastic cover so you can always carry it with you. A good Red Guard knows the book by heart and rarely reads anything else. Choose to be an example for the members in comunity. Report those whom lack dedication to Chairmen Mao.

                        Peng Dehuai is a traiter to his contry. He was an expolutative captialist and his very existance threatend china and her glory. He openly mocked the great chairmen Mao. Thankful our great liberation army was able to apprehend him before he could spread his imperialist idealogies. He is currently being kept alive in capitvity due to the mercy of chairmen mao.

                        This is a great example of a proper female chinese citizen. She never leaves the house without her red book. While she's out she reads her red book to pass the time. She wears red to reinforce her loyality to communist china. Young woman Chairmen mao erges you to take the example of this young woman and to keep strengthing your loyality to china

                        The great leap forward is a genuis ideal devised by the devine Chairmen Mao himself. It is a united chinese effort to improve chinas steal production in order to grow her power and influence around the word. We the chinese people must work together to bring chairmen maos china to life.
